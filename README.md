This is the begining of my Python journey. I have zero knowledge about Python but I now know Javascript well after completing the Zero to Mastery Web Developer Course. I plan to learn about what benefits python brings in the world of technology. I know it can be applied to mahcine learning, data science, automation, and web development. I am eager to dive deeper into these topics to see where Python would be beneficial to use. Every tool has it's use case and its pros and cons. I started this Python course on 10/19/2022
